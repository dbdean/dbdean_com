# About me

I'm a machine learning leader, researcher and data engineer with 19+ years
of experience in developing and improving state-of-the art
machine-learning research algorithms and turning them into useful,
reusable code that can make life easier for researchers, software
engineers, and everyone else!

## I'm a Data Science Leader

I've led the Learning Analytics Team at [TAFE NSW] for 5 years, helping grow
the ability of TAFE NSW to take a data-science approach, including prototyping
and evaluating AI and ML techniques, to improve the learning experiences for
vocational training across the entirety of TAFE NSW.

I have enjoyed supervising PhD students in the past and have done occasional
seasonal academic work.

Throughout 2017, I worked with the University of Queensland developing
an exciting new [Masters of Data Science][MDataSc], and I enjoyed
developing datasets and teaching material that helps in the training
of future professional data scientists.

I have also done some mentoring with [CoderDojo Brisbane][coderdojo],
and helping kids get excited about coding is pretty awesome.

## I'm a geospatial enthusiast and OpenStreetMap evangalist

When I was still in Brisbane, I ran local events for the OpenStreetMap
community.  So, if you came here looking for OpenStreetMap events in
Brisbane, please go have a look at the
[Brisbane Events Page][bneevents] on the OSM Wiki, or my
[EventBrite][ev] page.

Armidale is a bit quiet for this sort of thing, but it would be great
to get similar events running here.

I've been an [OpenStreetMap][osm] [member][osmprofile] since 2007, and was
responsible for a lot of the original mapping and social events in
Brisbane, Australia. I want to get more into AI and machine-learning
for GIS applications to help the OpenStreetMap community.

## I've worked in medical machine learning

In the past, I have done some machine-learning consultation work with two
exciting medical machine-learning start-ups, [Wink Health][wink] in
California, and [M3dicine][stethee] in Brisbane.  It's great to be
able to help medical professionals and the general population to get
access to improved health care through innovative signal processing
and machine learning.

## I've been a speech and image ML researcher

I have been working with audio-visual speech since 2004,
and loved showing that visual information is almost always
complementary to acoustic over a wide range of applications.

**Speaker recognition and diarisation**: A large part of my 
post-doctoral experience focused on conducting research, development
and commercialisation of state of the art speaker recognition and diarisation research.

## I have publications

As of March 2023, I have 1,664 citations across more than 90 publications,
with 44 publications having more than 10 citations, and a h-index
of 21. More details, and a full list of publications can be found on
my [Google Scholar profile][scholar].
